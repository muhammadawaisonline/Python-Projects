The Documents has simple to advance python projects.

**Python Project: Password Manager**
Features:
Add a new account with a password.
Retrieve stored passwords.
Optionally, you can encrypt the passwords for added security.

What You Learn:
File I/O: Reading from and writing to files to store data persistently.
Dictionaries: Storing data in key-value pairs (e.g., account).
User Input: Handling user inputs and sanitizing them with strip().
Loops & Conditionals: Creating a menu-driven program with repeated actions.
Basic Error Handling: Checking if files and data exist before accessing them.
Extensions:
Encryption: Encrypt the passwords using Python's cryptography or hashlib modules for added security.
Password Strength Checker: Add a function that checks if the password is strong (e.g., it contains uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).
Search Accounts: Add functionality to search for accounts by name.
This project will help you learn many useful Python skills while building a practical tool!


**Python Project: Budget Tracker**
Features:
Add expenses and income.
View the current balance.
List all transactions.
Save and load transactions from a file.

What You Learn:
File Handling: Reading and writing transactions to a file.
List Management: Storing transactions in lists and manipulating them.
Calculations: Summing up expenses and income to track the balance.
Error Handling: Using try-except blocks to handle invalid input.
Loops and Menus: Implementing a menu-driven application with continuous options.
Extensions:
Categories: Add categories for transactions (e.g., "groceries", "rent", "salary") for better organization.
Date Support: Add dates to transactions and allow filtering by date.
Graphical Representation: Display the expenses and income using graphs with libraries like matplotlib.




**Python Project: To-Do List Application**
Features:
Add new tasks.
View all tasks.
Mark tasks as complete.
Delete tasks.
Save tasks to a file and load them when the program starts.

What You Learn:
File I/O: Storing tasks in a file to make them persistent.
List Operations: Adding, updating, and deleting tasks stored as tuples.
User Interaction: Building a menu-driven application for better user experience.
Conditional Statements: Handling different user choices in a loop.
Extensions:
Deadlines: Add deadlines to tasks and sort them by urgency.
Priorities: Allow users to assign a priority level to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
Task Categories: Add categories (e.g., "work", "personal") to tasks for better organization.
This project will help you build skills in list management, user interaction, and file handling while creating a useful to-do list app!





**Weather Application**
**Python Project: Weather Application**
Features:
Input the name of a city.
Fetch and display the weather information using an API.
Handle errors (e.g., invalid city names or API connection issues).
Prerequisites:
You need an API key from a weather API provider, such as OpenWeatherMap. Sign up and get your free API key.

**What would we learn from it?**
What You Learn:
API Usage: How to send HTTP requests and parse JSON responses using Python.
JSON Parsing: Extracting specific data from a JSON response.
Error Handling: Handling network errors and incorrect user input.
Libraries: Introduction to third-party libraries (requests).
Loops and Conditionals: Building a user-friendly, interactive CLI tool.
Extensions:
Forecast Feature: Add functionality to show a weather forecast for multiple days using a different API endpoint.
Save Weather Data: Store weather data in a file for future reference.
Error Logging: Log errors to a file instead of just printing them.
This project will help you understand how to work with external data and APIs while building something practical!
